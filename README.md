# Course Management API üéì

## Overview
The Course Management API is designed to support a Learning Management System (LMS) by providing functionalities for user authentication, course management (CRUD operations), and progress tracking for students.

## Features
- **User Authentication:** Register new users and authenticate existing ones using JWT tokens.
- **Course Management:** Perform CRUD operations on courses (teachers only).
- **Progress Tracking:** Track and update student progress within courses.
- **Role-Based Access Control:** Differentiate between student and teacher roles for appropriate access permissions.
- **Swagger Documentation:** API endpoints are documented using Swagger for clarity and ease of integration.

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è
- **Node.js**: Backend JavaScript runtime environment.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js.
- **MySQL**: Relational database management system for data storage.
- **Sequelize**: Promise-based Node.js ORM for MySQL.
- **Swagger**: API documentation tool for describing and visualizing RESTful APIs.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Securely transmit information between parties as a JSON object.
